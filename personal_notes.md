Containers are processes. CHROOT + NAMESPACES + CGROUPS

## Namespaces - linux kernel feature

- Mount (mnt)
- Process ID (pid)
- Network (net)
- Interprocess Communication (ipc)
- Time
- User ID (user)
- UTS (Host and domain names)

## CGroups

- Resource management for the process. Resource limiting - processes cannot exceed a configured memory/cpu limit
- Prioritization - some processes get a larger share of CPU utilization
- Introduced by Google 2006 - process containers, merged as cgroups

## Docker Engine
